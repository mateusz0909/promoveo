# Lemmi Studio â€“ Product Feature Overview

## Executive Summary

For every developer, the greatest feeling is finishing the code. But the greatest frustration is the barrier that comes next. The project is built, but it's not *live*. Your momentum stalls at the final, creativity-draining mile: creating all the required store content.

**This is why we built Lemmi Studio.**

The name comes from Latin, meaning "I move forward." Our entire purpose is to propel your project through the final, tedious phase of content creation and carry your momentum across the finish line.

**Lemmi Studio is your new go-live kit.** It's an AI-powered toolkit designed to automate the entire App Store launch process. We handle the laborious design and writing tasks so you can stay focused on what you do best: building incredible software.
