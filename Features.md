# Lemmi Studio – Product Feature Overview

## Executive Summary

Independent builders sprint through product engineering only to stall at launch. Screenshots need framing, copy needs polishing, landing pages need crafting, and the App Store has unforgiving checklists. **Lemmi Studio** clears that final mile.

Named after the Latin *lemmī* (“I move forward”), Lemmi Studio is the AI-powered go-live kit that handles App Store storytelling from first screenshot to polished landing page. We automate the tedious parts without stealing your creative control, so you keep momentum all the way to “Ready for Sale.”

## 🎯 Value Pillars

### AI-Perfected Store Visuals
- Transform raw screenshots into persuasive App Store images with AI-authored headings and subheadings.
- Auto-detect accent colors, respect device frames, and apply curated themes with live previews.
- Refine layouts in the canvas editor—drag, rotate, resize, swap fonts, or switch themes before saving immutable versions.

### Conversion-Ready ASO Copy
- Generate titles, subtitles, promotional text, descriptions, and keyword sets tuned to Apple guidelines.
- Regenerate the full package or a single field without overwriting other edits; character counters keep you compliant.
- Copy-to-clipboard shortcuts and toast feedback turn approvals into a single click.

### Landing Pages in Minutes
- Feed a project ID, select a hero image, drop in an optional logo, and let AI draft a complete marketing page.
- Device-aware mockups, translated static copy, and bundled assets ship in one downloadable ZIP.
- Previous builds stay accessible, so you can iterate without losing history.

### Operational Confidence
- Studio dashboard highlights recent work; history search keeps archives handy.
- Autosave protects ASO edits, while Supabase-backed storage versioning safeguards image changes.
- Authenticated downloads, project deletion controls, and progress toasts keep teams informed at every step.

## 🔄 Product Workflow

1. **Authenticate & Launch** – Log in with Supabase Auth. The Studio dashboard surfaces recent projects and quick-start CTA; Project History provides full search and filters.
2. **Step 1 · Upload** – Provide app metadata, choose language and device, and upload up to 10 screenshots. Client-side compression and aspect-ratio validation guarantee compliant assets.
3. **Step 2 · Describe** – Optionally auto-generate per-screenshot descriptions with AI, or edit manually to steer the prompt.
4. **Step 3 · Studio Tabs** –
	- **Images**: Review generated marketing images, download singles or the full ZIP, or launch the canvas editor for fine-tuning.
	- **Text Content**: Inspect AI copy with character counts, copy/share instantly, or regenerate specific fields.
	- **Overview**: Adjust project metadata, see creation/update timestamps, and manage deletion.
	- **Landing Page**: Configure App Store ID, pick a hero visual, upload a logo (2 MB limit), preview device mockups, and generate a fresh landing-page bundle.
5. **Export & Iterate** – Download Supabase-backed ZIPs, regen content on demand, or revisit any project later from the dashboard/history without losing context.
